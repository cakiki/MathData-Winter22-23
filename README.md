# Mathematical foundations of data analysis
Winter semester 22-23, University of Leipzig, 10-INF-DS201

Goals:
- Understand the definitions of standard data science terms, and the associated mathematical terms
- Understand the proofs of how commonly used techniques in data science work
- Implement the algorithms and examples with a computer program
- Investigate the math behind your favorite topic in data science

We first cover two introductory topics
1. Linear algebra
  - Subspaces
  - Orthogonality
  - The pseudo-inverse
  - the singular value decomposition
2. Probability Theory

We then proceed with the following four themes commonly seen in data science

3. Network analysis
  - Graphs and the Laplace matrix
  - The spectrum of a graph
  - Markov processes in networks
  - Centrality measures
4. Machine learning
  - Data, models, and learning
  - Regeression in statistical models
  - Principal component analysis (method for dimension reduction)
  - Support vector machines (binary classification method)
5. Topological data analysis
  - Simplicial complexes and homology
6. Matrices and tensors
  - Low rank matrices and tensors
